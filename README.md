Hidden Binding Rules, to-dos and donts

To-dos:

1. If IPS requests for Black Buckram, you NEED to use Black Buckram at all cost (afaik Cyberjaya has no such option of binding, need to go cheras, serdang, SK, bukit jalil etc. I went to Serdang for this). Else they will reject your submission ( an account based on my friend ).
2. Check for top and down margin. It is as shown in Appendix A. Also, font type for the contents inside hardcover is Times New Roman, BUT, Cover's font type is Calibri. This may be a little headache for LaTeX user specifically Overleaf users. What you can do is separating them to two separate pdfs.
3. Spine-lettering incoming...soon...
